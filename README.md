# Music Releases
First week of React. We did a new spotify app with new albums and single releases. 

## The problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

First I got all data that was needed for the project and just populating it up so I had something to start with. Then I did some more components and tried to split things up to minimal components. 
Also learned how important "key" is in the React world. 
Started with all requirements and then the "extras" for the project. 

Tech used: 
- JSX
- CSS
- API
